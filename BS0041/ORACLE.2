Drugs may be bad in real life, but in this game they are your Friend..
GEt everybody outa things and the game will go MUCH smoother.  Note that
Barney will probably punish you if you try to get him high but everyone
else is a lot easier to go boom boom boom.  Baby Bop is the second
hardest to kill and the kids are easier but there are four of em.
