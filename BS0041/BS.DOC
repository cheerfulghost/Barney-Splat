    *Introduction:
BarneySplat!
By ASCII Express
- Bong Software!!!

Free! well... near free anyways (see the end) DISPARE NOT!

What is it?
Read the instructions!
But since I'm nice here's a summary:
Users get to Kill Barney (Yes, the purple Dino!), Baby Bop, and four of
Barney's Kidee Friends!
It's a ton of laughs and since mostly EVERYONE hates Barney, it should
be kinda popular!

WATCH FOR VERSION .004 soon!

A SERIOUS NOTE:
My friend runs a board. My friend's board receives calls JUST TO PLAY
IT! So please put it up and spread it around!  It can even be run
without a BBS! So please see the section if applicable.

Copyrights? I'M WAITING FOR YOUR LETTER! PBS! Just think before you
act.. you'd lose more money trying to take me to court.. but one line of
code reinacts the imfamous Censorship routines. If you have no clue as
to what I am talking about, worry not.

*Now for the installation:

**BBS
What you need to know is what drop file you want to use. If you aren't
sure here's a little chart..

RemoteAccess: Dorinfo1.def or Door.sys
VBBS: Either chain.txt, door.sys, or dorinfo1.def
WWIV: chain.txt
Wildcat: door.sys or callinfo.bbs I believe
Telegard/Renegarbage/T.A.G.: either chain.txt, door.sys, or dorinfo1.def
JetBBS!!!!!!: Door.sys, dorinfo1.def, or chain.txt

I think...

Just check your BBS manual if you aren't sure still..

Now, after you know that just setup the door using the commandline
parameters.  BTW THIS IS Taken Directly from the BOI Document by Andrew
J. Mead, so you KNOW it's right! <GRIN>

        command   dropfile      BBS software - Notes
         /1       PCBOARD.SYS   PCBoard 12.x (see /P)
         /2       JUMBER.DAT    2 A.M.
         /3                     OPUS 1.13 (not available)
         /4       CHAIN.TXT     WWIV, VBBS, TAG, Telegard
         /5       CURRUSER.BBS  RyBBS
         /6       SFDOORS.DAT   Spitfire BBS
         /7       AUNTIE.SYS    Auntie BBS (same format as /1)
         /8                     Sapphire BBS (not available)
         /9       command line  Searchlight, Remote Access, Simplex
         /D       DOOR.SYS      DoorWay to Unlimited Doors, GT
                                NOTE:This is the "Short" Door.Sys see /S
         /F       USERINFO.TXT  Forum
         /G       CALLINFO.BBS  Genesis (beta)
         /H       INFO.TXT      Phoenix
         /M       NUMBER.TXT    ModuleX
         /O       LASTUSER.DAT  Opus 1.14
         /Oxx     LASTUSxx.DAT  Opus 1.14 where "xx" is the task number
                                in hexadecimal
         /P       PCBOARD.SYS   PCBoard 14.x (see /1)
         /S       DOOR.SYS      GAP, Force
                                NOTE: This is the "Long" Door.Sys see /D
         /W       CALLINFO.BBS  WildCat!, Telegard

         /R       DOORINFO.DEF  DorInfo is the most widely used file.
         /R#      DORINFO#.DEF  EIS-PC, FoReM, OLEcom, QuickBBS, RBBS,
                                Remote Access, TAG, TPBoard, UBBS, and
                                VBBS. the "#" represents the node number

        If this command is missing, the door will default to local mode.

        Drop File Path
            If (as recommended) you do not run your online doors from
            your BBS directory, you need to tell the BOI where to find
            the drop file.  You can either copy the file, or add the
            drop file's path to the command line.  Here's an example
            with WildCat! assuming the BBS is in c:\wcat.

          doorgame /w:c:\wcat\

            Note: the "\" on the end of the path is required, and that
            the first ":" (w:c) is optional (for clarity).

Ok, now this is me again...  Just set it up like

@echo off
cd <the directory your Fuhrer game is>
fuhrer.exe <commandline stuff>
cd\bbs <-- or whereever your BBS is
exit
@echo on

I am writing an install program, maybe for the next version!

**Personal
Nothing is needed (not even a Drop file!).. Just type BS and off you go.

Note: set it up if you are having a party. Put it in a looping batch
file. Encourage friendly competition. Ads a lot of fun!

<<<IMPORTANT>>>
In either case, create a BS.CFG file.  The .cfg file is two lines...
They are either a Y or an N. Make sure the Y or N is on the first
character of the line.  The first line should be a Y or an N based on
wether if you want the game to keep track of the player's time.  If Y,
when the player's time on the BBS runs out, it will kick them out. If N,
they have unlimited time within the game..
The second line is a Y or an N, based on wether they can only play once
per day or not. If y, they can only play once per day, if n they can
play as many times as they want.

*BS Scripts
This is a new feature to barneysplat...  The basic thing behind a BS
script started when a user wrote me some email, asking how "new scenes"
were added...  He had an old version, you see, but then it hit me Let's
bring his little fantasy to life... so I wipped up a simple scripting
(mini programming) language, for the purpose of writing BS events.  Even
if you can't program, almost failed "Truebasic" class, or think
batchfiles are hard, as long as you play the game a bit, you will be
able to make your own BarneySplat! scenes in no time.  that was a very
long sentence...  Anyway, before I go into it, a little about the game,
so you won't mess anything up.
<<<ALERT!>>> PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS PART BEFORE EVEN ATTEMPTING TO
WRITE SCRIPTS! THE SYNTAX CHECKING IS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTANT! IT WILL
FUCK UP IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS DOC AND DO WHAT IT SAYS! REVIEW IT WITH
A MICROSCOPE IF YOU HAVE TO! Or put a copy over your bed, and read it as
you are going night-night, and have happy barneysplatting scripting
dreams (what a nerd!)>>>
A barneysplat script must have the extention .bs, whatever.bs,
shrooms.bs whatever. shrooms.bs is a good example that I wrote.
The first two lines of the script are the title of the scene, and the
author's name (handle, whatever).
The third line of a script is the prompt for the menu...  Be creative,
whatever...
The game is devided into five days (monday-friday, duh!), and three
turns in each day, for 15 turns (5 days*3 turns).  The first two values
in the script file (lines 4-5) MUST be the day number to allow this event
(1-5, 0 if it doesn't matter), and the second line must be the turn
number of the day (0=don't care, 1=after the random event, 2=after the field
trip, 3=right before the day ends.)

After this comes the percent of the event comming up, 1-100.
Next comes the opening info...  Print anything cool that relates to the
scene, like "Barney says Let's do so and so..." etc.  You can write
however much you want. Terminate with a . on a blank line for example
Barney says "Let's learn to molest Children I'm good at it!!!"
"um..." a kid cires
.

Next come all the command letters for the menu... Put them all next to
each other AND DO NOT DUPLICATE! THINGS WILL FUCK UP!  I AM SERIOUS!
IMPORTANT! Make sure that the last command letter is the choice to quit
the fun...

For example
ABCDEFGQ
Now, comes the menu which will be printed. One choice for a line.
Something like the following including the previously mentioned command
letters is what will work.
ABCDEFGQ
(A)rest someone
(B)omb someone
(C)hoak someone
(D)rug someone
(E)xecute someone
(F)uck up someone
(G)ive someone a free tatoo on their butt
(Q)uit the fun

see? No . is needed for this.
Okay, now you have to start each choice with
Choice c
where c is the command letter like
Choice A

Auright....  Now, comes the opening of that event... End with a . just
like the opening text of the whole scene...
Next, comes the random bungle.  This is
what chance the event has of happening. There are three commands here,
you can use one, two, or...
















ALL THREEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! HOW THE HELL DID YOU NOT SEE THAT
COMMING?!  Anyway, they are
RANDOM <chance> <max>
Generates a random number from 1 to <max>, and if it is less than, or
equal to <chance>, then the event will happen for example
Random 1 500
means that there is a 1 in 500 chance of happening...
Ha.hahahahahahahaha.aha.ahaha.ahh.ahah.aha.haah.ahah.ah.aha!

Percent <percent>
Self explanitory
Percent 20
means there is a twenty percent chance of happening

Userpercent
lets the user input a percent, and uses that number they entered of
happening.

Okay, I lied, there are actually four
Score <points>
Will continue if the player has that number of points or over

Terminate this whole thing with a .
like
percent 20
.

radness...
Okay, now the meat of the script...
So we have two things that can happen now either success or failed.
So start with either Success or Failed on a line on itself... everything
between this line and a . will be executed. Then put the other...  and
end that with a dot too like
Success
<code>
.
Failed
<code>
.
You see? It's really quite simple SHUT UP! STOP THINKING ABOUT HOW
COMPLEX IT IS! SHUT UP! sorry, highschool does this to a man's sanity...
okay, here are the commands, an unlimited ammount are okay...

Print <string>
um what do you think? Sends the string to the ink printer, and if the
printer happens to be on, causes a short circuit, thus setting the
entire paper bin ablaze, along with anything within a fifty yard
radius...
Actually, it mearly prints the text to the user.

NL
Sends a blank line (null)...

Log <string>
heheuhuhuhuh he said "log"...  You know that funky player log at the end
of the game that Barney recites to the kids? This lets you put an entry
into it for the end. There are a maximum of twenty entries for the whole
game, so don't go nuts with this.. (nuts? log? Sick.)

Killoff <player>
Kills off the player in <player>, <player> can be
Barney, Bop, Kid1, kid2, kid3, kid4, or rkid (random kid). Figure the
others out.

Score <points>
Envites <points> ammount of nekked hookers over to your house so you can
score with them. um waitasec, no, actually it adds (or subtracts)
<points> to the score. If the points gets below -100 they Die!

Screwup <player> <points>
Gets <player> more drunk. Points are whatever, once they hit 100 they
die in a bloody mess...  Use this carefully, obviously. SOmething like
80-90 would almost certainly kill off the player unless in the beginning
of the day. <player> is
Barney
Bop
Kid1
kid2
kid3
kid4
Allkids (Woo! Woo!)
Everyone (WOOOOOOOoooooooooo!)

Okay, that is all the commands... not too bad... It's really not that
complex. NOW LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED!... Here is the skeleton of
the code. I could make a joke about skeletons comming out of the closet,
and the sexual connotations, but I will not.

Title
Author
menu prompt
day number or 0 for event
day turn or 0 for event
percent of this event happening
opening info
.
command letters for menu
The meniu, one choice per line
(do this next bit until the end)
Choice <letter>
Info for the choice
can be as many lines as ya want
.
Chances of happening
.
Success (or failed)
code
.
The opposite of the above (failed or success)
code
.
<end of loop, repeat for all choices>

Now see? Was that hard? No. it wasn't.  That last item with the summary
like that is like the Cliffnotes, and as any highschool student will
tell you, cliffnotes beat reading the real book 99% of the time! THEY
RULE! Whoever came up with them is a genius and a considered friend... I
heard there are cliffnotes on CDROM? Is this true? that would Rule...
Okay, that's it for scripting. I can't stress enough, Upload all scripts
if you can to my BBS and I will include all scripts I get into the next
version... THis is gunna rule if enough people get scripting!

*Disclaimer:
I won't be liable for Peanuts (ddi you know you can get a little high by
smoking Peanut shells?)!  I hearby say Bye bye blue sky to all
liabilities of this game.  If you use it, it's your risk.  I don't need
a lawsuit now, I never have and never will want or need one.  If you are
a lawyer, isn't this unprofessional? YEAH? Good. I like it this way.
really? Yes. Hey, Ever talk to yourself?  Yeah, all the time...  Well,
anyway, if this causes a user to flip out because they are a nazi, and
invite Adolph, Schlemging, and Auschwitz over to your house and if they
do various things to your brain, spinal chord, body, arms, legs, feet,
and money, Don't blame me...


*Help!

Dedications:
THe following people gave me ideas:
Reverend Warthog: Came up with the name!
Innocent Man: GOT YOUR Handle right this time!
Sibyl, You're a straightedged fool, but we still like you anyway.  A
note to any females reading this (yeah right): DO NOT EVER, EVER, EVER
DUMP YOUR BOYFRIEND, OR SAY ANYTHING THAT WILL LEAD TO SUCH ACTIONS, ("I
will not talk to you until you get off the drugs", for instance)
IF HE IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ANY POWERFULL MIND ALTERANTS (cough).
HE WILL FREAK OUT AND HAVE THE MOST HELLISH TEN MINUTES OF HIS LIFE,
GARENTEED.... not that I'd know or anything... dammit, I wish I were in
Holland.
Cerebus and Zenman: For being truly hoopy friends.. and Cerebus for
smoking up even if it *WAS* banana peals. "Do you see... the man?" also
you guys gave me great ideas.
Righteous: for more demented ideas
Cat woman and for that matter all the other sysops in Montana: for
telling me about the time problem, and the once per day option..
The countless people who submitted ideas! You are are cool, even if i
never implemented your idea.  And by the way, when submitting, Please
don't ask "Did you submit my idea?" I get a few ideas a week, and
quickly (within five minutes) lose track of who said what.
Barney: I would say go to hell, but that is to good for you. May the
Jihad have their fun.
Andrew J. Mead for writing this door interface which is great and
lovable hoopy and other stuff.
Gregory P. Smith: For writing Pavatar! If you programmers want to add
avatar, and ansi/avatar music, THIS IS THE WAY! Every time you hear an
ansi music sound, think of this guy's name!
Douglass Adams for providing the word "Hoopy"

You, for running this game!


Good bye, good luck, and good fun!

Se vi povas kompreni xci tion, vi estas bonulo!

*Registration
I am allways inventing new bonuses for registration, so this is not the
only Way!  So call if you are interested in free registration (HA ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha!)  Anyway, if you want to register right now, just
send me whatever you think this game is worth!  Of course, some
conceiled pipe tobacco would be much appriciated too! IF YOU PICK THIS
ROUTE, PLEASE CONCEIL IT VERY WELL! parents, you know.  Also, do not
openly say "Here is some Pipe tobacco!" my mom likes reading my mail
sometimes.arg. and let me know first.
Another alternative (prefered) is to, after checking with me, send me a copy
of a tape of any trance/techno/electronic/newage music... if I do not have
it, send a copy along and you will get a registration...  Oh wait a
minute, copying tapes is illegal.
"Please don't arrest me. I ain't doin
nothin illegal man! I'm not...."
"Shut up, son, and let's see the tapes."
"What tapes? I don't know what you're talking about."
"Don't make us beat the fuck out of you with this here club, boy, show
us the fucking tapes, godammit..."
etc. sorry, had to be said.
You will receive a key..
DO NOT GIVE THIS OUT! or you will be beaten with an aluminium baseball
bat.

    *Frequently Asked Questions <FAQ>
Here are frequently asked questions. Before giving up or before calling
me why not read this.

Q. When I run BarneySplat!, I get weird looking symbols like [36;40m and
stuff.
A. You've gotta load Ansi.sys. TO do this, put a line in config.sys that
reads
DEVICE=C:\dos\ansi.sys
or wherever your ansi.sys is.

Q. BS works fine locally but doesn't work remotely.
A. Probably you've got the wrong Door.sys Use /S, I've never seen /D
used...  If it's something else and you figure it out let me know and I
will try to help you out in this case.

Q. It allways says Cannot find dropfile or something like that.
A. You've gotta configure the dropfile correctly. See up above for an
explanation.
Q. I want to call ASCII Express but I'm not sure what time it is in
Pensylvania.
A. DOn't worry! Give me a call anyway! I'm in eastern time... but if I
am assleep/don't feel like talking to people I will just turn off my
phone... Give me a call. we can talk... I have made a number of friends
through BS--it's quite cool, really...

Q. I think this game is horrible because it says stuff about drugs and
other horrible things.
A> Delete this program, then, and forget about it.

Q. I think this FAQ is going too long and is too pointless.
A. Agreed. Bye, all!
