You hear someone in the crowd yell "GET OFF THE STAGE!" one of the
"Singers" pulls out a .38 and shoots them on the spot.
He then yells "Ay! SOMEONE GOES IN THE MOSH PIT! YOU DON'T KILL Them!
Help em out!!!"
`
Barney yelps loudly as he is crushed against the wall and the ground.
Baby Bop is thrown on the ground, and nearly crushed.
One of the kids is hurled violently against the ground and then trampled over.
